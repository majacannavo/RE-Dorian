############# TEMPORAL ANALYSIS #############

#create temporal data frame & graph it

############# NETWORK ANALYSIS #############

#create network data frame. Other options for 'edges' in the network include mention, retweet, and reply
dorianNetwork <- network_graph(dorian3, c("quote"))

#Please, this is incredibly ugly... if you finish early return to this function and see if we can modify its parameters to improve aesthetics
